# Airline Flight Delay & Operational Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on airline flight operation data to understand delay patterns, cancellation trends, and overall airline performance. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, raw flight data is cleaned, processed, and transformed into meaningful insights that highlight operational trends across airlines, days, and months.

The analysis helps in identifying key factors influencing flight delays and provides a clear data-driven view of airline operations.

## Project Requirements

1. **Python Programming Environment**  
   A functional Python setup using **Jupyter Notebook**, **Google Colab**, or **Spyder** to develop and execute the analysis.

2. **Essential Python Libraries**  
   The project uses core data analysis and visualization libraries:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation and preprocessing  
   - `numpy` for numerical computations  
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization

3. **Flight Operations Dataset**  
   A structured **CSV dataset** containing flight-related information such as delays, airlines, flight dates, distance, and cancellation status.

4. **Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering**  
   Handling missing values, removing duplicate records, and creating new features such as delay status, day of the week, and month to support effective analysis.

5. **Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization**  
   Performing EDA using statistical summaries and multiple visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and insights related to airline performance and flight delays.
