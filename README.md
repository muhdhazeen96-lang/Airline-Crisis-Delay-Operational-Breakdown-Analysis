Airline Flight Delay & Operational Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on airline flight operation data to understand delay patterns, cancellation trends, and overall airline performance. Using Python-based data analysis and visualization techniques, raw flight data is cleaned, processed, and transformed into meaningful insights that highlight operational trends across airlines, days, and months.

The analysis helps in identifying key factors influencing flight delays and provides a clear data-driven view of airline operations.

Project Requirements
Python Programming Environment
A functional Python setup using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab to develop, execute, and visualize the analysis.

Essential Python Libraries
The project requires the following libraries:

pandas for data loading, cleaning, and manipulation
numpy for numerical operations
matplotlib and seaborn for exploratory data visualization
Flight Operations Dataset
A structured CSV dataset containing airline flight information such as arrival delay, cancellation status, airline name, distance, flight date, and time-related attributes.

Data Cleaning and Feature Engineering
Data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, removing duplicate records, converting date columns, and creating new features such as delay status, day of week, and month for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is performed using summary statistics and multiple visualization techniques to identify trends, patterns, and operational insights related to flight delays and airline performance.

Key Analysis Performed
Data cleaning and preprocessing
Handling missing and duplicate values
Feature creation for delay status, weekdays, and months
Analysis of arrival delays and cancellations
Airline-wise performance comparison
Day-wise and month-wise delay trends
Tools & Technologies
Python
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib, Seaborn
How to Run the Project

Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project contains airline flight operation details. It includes information such as flight dates, airline names, arrival delays, cancellation status, flight distance, taxi-out time, and time-related attributes. This data helps in analyzing delay patterns and overall airline operational performance.

Project Workflow
Load the flight dataset into the notebook.
Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
Create new features such as delay status, day of week, and month.
Perform exploratory data analysis using charts and summary statistics.
Interpret the results to understand delay trends and airline performance.
Key Results and Insights
Most flights operate on time, with only a small percentage experiencing major delays.
Flight delays vary based on airline, day of travel, and month.
Certain airlines show better on-time performance compared to others.
Cancellations form a smaller portion of total flights but still impact operations.
Data visualization helps clearly identify operational trends and patterns.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Exploratory Data Analysis and visualization techniques can convert raw airline data into meaningful insights. The analysis provides a better understanding of flight delay behavior, airline performance, and operational trends, emphasizing the importance of data-driven approaches in real-world aviation analysis.
